# Bad Apple TRS-80

This repo converts the famous
[Bad Apple music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtutLA63Cp8)
to an assembly language program for the TRS-80
Model III to show the video. Currently only 490 frames
will fit in 48k of RAM (about 100 bytes each). There's no audio.

To use this, run (on a Mac):

```sh
python3 process_image.py | pbcopy
```

and paste into the [My TRS-80 IDE](https://www.my-trs-80.com/ide/)
webapp.
